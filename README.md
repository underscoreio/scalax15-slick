# Quick Start

Follow the instructions below prior to the conference to get started.
Doing so will prevent you having to download the internet on conference wifi!
You will need a Java 8 compatible JVM and a familiar programmer's text editor or IDE.
If you have any problems please let me know on the [Gitter channel].

1. Clone this repo and switch to the root directory:

    ~~~ bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/underscoreio/scalax15-slick.git

    $ cd scalax15-slick
    ~~~

2. Run the example code using SBT.
   This will take a few minutes to run the first time.
   You'll need an internet connection to download dependencies:

    ~~~ bash
    $ ./sbt.sh run     # "./sbt.bat run" on Windows
    ~~~

3. If you see this famous script from 2001, you're good:

    ~~~
    Dave: Hello, HAL. Do you read me, HAL? (#1)
    HAL: Affirmative, Dave. I read you. (#2)
    Dave: Open the pod bay doors, HAL. (#3)
    HAL: I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that. (#4)
    ~~~

   If not, let me know on the [Gitter channel].

4. If you use an IDE that requires further setup, do that now.
   I've included the `sbteclipse` and `ensime-sbt` plugins in the build.

I'll post the complete workshop code and slides immediately prior to the conference.
All you'll have to do on the day is `git pull` and start coding.
Looking forward to seeing you there!
